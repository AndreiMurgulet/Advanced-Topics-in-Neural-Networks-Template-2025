Lab Notebook

1. [Complex Yet Simple Training Pipeline](https://github.com/Tensor-Reloaded/AI-Learning-Hub/blob/main/resources/advanced_pytorch/ComplexYetSimpleTrainingPipeline.ipynb)
2. [Inference Optimization And TTA](https://github.com/Tensor-Reloaded/AI-Learning-Hub/blob/main/resources/advanced_pytorch/InferenceOptimizationAndTTA.ipynb)

The exercises from these notebook are a good preparation for homework 2, and can help you acquire MLOps or Data Science skills.

For self-study (for students who want to pass):
* Skim over the 2 references, LeCun (98) and Keskar (2017).
* Watch the videos for AlexNet and ResNet.
* Convolutions:
  * [But what is a convolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA) (convolution example; convolutions in image processing; convolutions and polynomial multiplication; FFT)
  * [CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/) (convolutions applied in neural networks)
* Hyperparameter tuning / experiment tracking:
  * Tensorboard: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html
  * Weights and Biases: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/pytorch

Advanced (for students who want to learn more):
* Learn how to choose hyperparameters and the influence of batch size:
  * [Gradient Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition](http://vision.stanford.edu/cs598_spring07/papers/Lecun98.pdf) (LeCun, 98)
  * [On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836) (Keskar, 2017)
* Read the foundational CNN papers:
  * AlexNet:
